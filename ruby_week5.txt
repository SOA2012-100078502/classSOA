edit "Gemfile" :http://pastebin.com/AGMAxaag
	=>
	# use Haml for templates
	gem 'haml'
	# use Ruby debugger
	group :development, :test do
  	 gem 'ruby-debug19'
	end

	=>This change does two things. 
	First, it specifies that we will use the Haml templating system rather than the built-in erb. 
	Second, it specifies that we want to use the interactive debugger ruby-debug19 during development and testing,
	but not in production.

after edit "Gemfile" :
	=>bundle install --without production

Start server:
	=>rails server
	=>surf the site "http://localhost:300/movies"

check error message 
	=>log/development.log

edit routes: http://pastebin.com/piLDY4eM
	=>edit "config/routes.rb"
	=>
	Myrottenpotatoes::Application.routes.draw do
  		resources :movies
  		root :to => redirect('/movies')
	end
	
	=>delete "public/index.html" if exists
	
	=>rake routes
	=>surf the site "http://localhost:300/movies"
	=>see a different error: uninitialized constant MoviesController.
	=>this means route is working correctly

deal with error of "uninitialized constant MoviesController"
	=>rails g controller movies #generate a movies controller
		(under apps/controllers dir)	
	=>edit "movies_controller.rb"
	=>
	def show
	edn

	=>surf the site "http://localhost:300/movies"
	=>see a different error: LoadError in MoviesController#index
